I smell heartbreak on my hands
I feel sick to my stomach
as I begin to stand
I see your outline in my bed
In the same spot
I watched him rest his head
I've done you wrong, I regret it
I write this song,
tryn'a forget it
Feel this emptiness in my chest
I feel surreal
but I'm feeling stressed
I need to do something
Fucked up for nothing
Oh I gotta just tell someone,
tell someone what I've done
Please bathe me now,
wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Oh no like gasoline
Wake up the morning after
You call, but I don't answer
And I can't look you in the eye
No matter how hard I try
You deserve forever
Not a boy looking for better
But as long as you're still here
I will try to keep you near
Please bathe me now,
wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Oh no like gasoline
Please bathe me now,
wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
