Are you insane like me
Been in pain like me
Bought a hundred-dollar bottle
of champagne like me
Just to pour that mother fucker
down the drain like me
Would you use your water bill
to dry the stain like me
Are you high enough
without the mary jane like me
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me
Do the people whisper
about you on the train like me
Saying that you shouldn't waste
your pretty face like me
And all the people say...
You can't wake up this is not a dream
You're part of a machine
you are not a human being
With your face all made up living on a screen
Low on self esteem so you run on gasoline
Oh I think there's a flaw in my code
Oh these voices won't leave me alone
My heart is gold and my hands are cold
Are you deranged like me
Are you strange like me
Lightin' matches just to swallow up
the flame like me
Do you call yourself a fucking hurricane like me
Pointing fingers
cause you never take the blame like me
