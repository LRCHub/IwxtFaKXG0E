gasoline
Keep climbing till you dle
Pour your gasoline till you die
Make desire into a groove
Make energy into a sound
Emotion into a shout
Pain into money Embody
everything
Exhaust every potential until
you die
Kill those in the way
Kill those in the way
You gotta get it all
You gotta get it all
Make porn the real thing
Make junk into the brand
An amateur becomes a pro
Fake into real
Make it what you dreamed of
Make it what you dreamed of
Kill those in the way
Kill those in the way
Pour your gasoline till you die
You gotta get it all
You gotta get it all
Kill those in the way
You gotta get it all
You gotta get it all
Keep climbing till you die
You keep climbing
Keep climbing till you die
Till you die
Till you die
die
