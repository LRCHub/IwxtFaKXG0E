And all the people say...
You can't wake up
this is not a dream
You're part of a machine
you are not a human being
With your face all made up
living on a screen
Low on self esteem
so you run on gasoline
Oh I think there's a flaw
in my code
Oh these voices
won't leave me alone
My heart is gold
and my hands are cold
Are you deranged like me
Are you strange like me
Lightin' matches
just to swallow up
the flame like me
Do you call yourself
a fucking hurricane like me
Pointing fingers
cause you never take the blame
like me
And all the people say...
You can't wake up
this is not a dream
You're part of a machine
you are not a human being
With your face all made up
living on a screen
Low on self esteem
so you run on gasoline
Oh I think there's a flaw
in my code
